# Personal Color Analysis Web Application

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload an image and receive a detailed personal color analysis based on the colors of their hair, skin, and eyes. The analysis determines the user's personal color type out of 20 defined types, as well as overall color classification.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ImageProcessing-team12/personalcolor_model.git
    cd personalcolor_model
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the Flask app**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

6. **Access the app in your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the web application.

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Upload an image file by clicking the "Select Image" button.

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image file on the main page (`index.html`).
2. **Feature Extraction**: The application uses image processing techniques to identify and extract the color properties of the hair, skin, and eyes from the uploaded image.
3. **Color Conversion and Analysis**:
    - Converts the color data to HSV format for detailed analysis.
    - Determines whether the color is clear or dull.
    - Calculates an overall color type based on average hue, lightness, saturation, and clarity.
4. **Result Display**: The results are shown on the `result.html` page, including the hair, skin, and eye types, and the overall personal color type.
